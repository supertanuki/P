Beta Version .53 - March 21, 2012
---------------------------------
- Added header image support. Much of this code was borrowed from the Twenty Eleven theme. The header image size is 1000 x 288 pixels. It supports adding custom header images to your site. You can specify a certain image, or randomly rotate images on each page load. If you attach a featured image to a post, and it's at least as big as the 1000 x 288 image size, the image will override the global header image setting and always be displayed on that post. This feature is accessible in Admin > Appearance > Header.
- NOTE: Since the above header image support uses built-in WordPress functions that also display the Site Title and Site Description in the header, the option to toggle Site Title/Description has been removed from the Alien Ship Theme Options page located at Theme Options > Design Options. The option to control the display of Site Title and Site Description are now located under Appearance > Header.
- Added loginform shortcode. Supports a redirect parameter. If redirect is not set, it returns to the current page. Usage: [loginform redirect="http://www.johnparris.com/alienship"]. If user is logged in, it shows nothing.

Version 0.3 - March 1, 2012
---------------------------
- Bottom Menu: If no menu is assigned in Admin > Appearance > Menus, no default menu is displayed. This keeps the default wp_page_menu from displaying and looking like crap. That menu is usually too big for this area. The Bottom Menu is meant to be small. This gives the option of not displaying the menu at all. Good if you’re doing menu related things in the footer widgets and don’t need it.
- Allow child themes.
- Redid the Top Menu in responsive mode to be more touch friendly. Increased font size and spacing of dropdown items. Removed bold text. Added the word “Menu” to the button to make it more obvious what it actually is to people who’ve never seen it before.

- Cleaned up header output via inc/cleanup.php
- Improved child theme friendliness.
- Changed post tag and post category display. Now uses the Bootstrap label to wrap each category and/or tag.
