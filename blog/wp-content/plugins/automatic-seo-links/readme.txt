== Description ==

Forget to put manually your links, just choose a word and a URL and this plugin will replace all matches in the posts of your blog.

**For each link, you can set:**

* Title 
* Target 
* Rel 

**Other features**

Also you can know every moment how many times a word has been changed.

This plugin just changes the words in plain text, if it finds a word in a link, title, header.. it would not be replaced.

In case the plugin finds more of once the same word in a post, it will only change the first one. 
This is to avoid black seo and inconveniences to the users.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What words will it replace? =

This plugin just changes the words in plain text, if it finds a word in a link or in a title it would not be replaced.

= If I have one word inside of another which one will be replaced? =

The first word to be checked, for example, if you have cafe (http://cafe.com) and metacafe (http://metacafe.com) and in your
post there is "metacafe" the first one to be checked (order list) would replace metacafe, but just one word, not both.

= Any problems? =

I've tested this plugins in two online wordpress blogs and I don't have any problems, it works fine (version 1.2) however if
you find a mistake send me an email to emilio [at] aesinformatica [dot] com
